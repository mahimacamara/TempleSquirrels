# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

TODO  Squirrel-Man

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

TODO  A pacman like game but instead of a pacman, ghost, and the little cirlce things I will add different things. The pacman will be replaced my a squirrel, the ghost will be trash particles and the circle stuff the pac man eats will be nuts.

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

TODO   
My software will run a pacman like game with a squirrel instead of chasing nuts. I really want to incorporate a login page that possibly saves user information. It will keep track of score and also have a game ending point. 
## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

TODO, if applicable N/A Michael Humphrey 

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

TODO, if applicable  Im not completely sure about my groupmates yet since communication isnt working but will edit when I talk to them.

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope. 

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

TODO I will like to accomplish on getting the pac man game working with or without the modifications I want to make. Such as how I have the squirrel idea.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

TODO 
I think I can accomplish getting the steps done in the tutorial before the deadline before I add my own concepts of the game to it.


### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

TODO The best outcome for my project would to have an an functional game you could at least play. 

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

TODO  Skills I would need to acquire to do this game would be game designing skills. Although I am using a tutorial to guide me to make a pacman game and using the pacman template I definitely want to change it up a bit and make my idea make sense with the game. I also honestly don't know the exact rules of pacman so I do need to do a little research of how the game is actually played. I know the basic universal concept of it though.
